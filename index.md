## Welcome to my website

If you're looking for information on my research, you've come to the right place. Here you'll find links to my published articles on the dynamical and chemical evolution of our planet, my CV and a little extra about me and some of my ideas about How The Earth Works.

### About

I am a Cecil and Ida Green Posdoctoral Scholar at the Institute for Geophysics and Planetary Physics, UC San Diego. I research the dynamical and chemical evolution of our planet.

### Short Bio

I'm a computational geophysicist who conducts research on mantle convection, volcanism and Earth's chemical evolution. I grew up in Sydney and earned my BSc from Macquarie University and PhD from the Australian National University. Currently a Green Scholar at UCSD, I was also a Carnegie Fellow at the Carnegie Institution for Science. I was a finalist for the Schmidt Science Fellowship in 2018 and in 2017 I received the [Study for Earth's Deep Interior award](https://connect.agu.org/sedi/awards) for my work on mantle plumes and how they sample the deep mantle.
